	The paper sorted out the measurement methods of social network influence from two aspects of network topology and user influence intensity, and mainly discussed three information transmission models of social network, namely, infectious disease model, independent cascade model and linear threshold model. 
 	On this basis, the paper establishes the user influence prediction model, and further divides the work roughly into data set acquisition, model building and experimental results evaluation. To be specific, this paper firstly builds a user node influence prediction model based on the real data set of web crawler from Weibo, one of the most popular social network platforms in China, after data processing in combination with the social network characteristics of Weibo, and using the DeepInf model for reference. Finally, the paper analyzes the experimental results and prospects the influence technology of social network.
